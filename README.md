# CS 161 Final Portfolio
# Joshua Barringer

This is a compilation of projects completed by me over the course of the CS161 course.  At the beginning of the course, I had never programmed before, so everything that I have made is starting from literally no knowledge about any programming language.  I believe that I have made a lot of progress and I plan on continuing my learning about programming and computers.

I tried to organize the files so they're easier to deal with.  The folders are organized by topic, and some of them are labeled better than others.  The project that I put the most work into is the bleakfallsbarrow project that I'm working on with John Warila.  We've got an engine working that is almost complete.  We've put a lot of work into it and I'm proud of the progress that I have made on the game and my programming knowledge.
