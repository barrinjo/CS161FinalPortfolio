# CS 161 Final Portfolio
# Joshua Barringer

This is a compilation of projects completed by me over the course of the CS161 course.  At the beginning of the course, I had never programmed before, so everything that I have made is starting from literally no knowledge about any programming language.  I believe that I have made a lot of progress and I plan on continuing my learning about programming and computers.
